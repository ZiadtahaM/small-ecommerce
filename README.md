# Angular E-Commerce Product Platform

![E-Commerce Product Grid](Screenshot%2025-09-27%222035.png)

This is a modern, single-page e-commerce application built with Angular. It provides a dynamic and responsive user experience for browsing, searching, and viewing product details. The platform is designed for high performance and scalability, featuring real-time search filtering and seamless navigation between a product overview grid and detailed single-product pages.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Product Grid:** Displays all products in a clean, responsive, card-based layout.
*   **Real-Time Search:** Instantly filters the product grid as the user types in the search bar.
*   **Detailed Product View:** A dedicated route (`/singlepost/:id`) to display comprehensive details for each product, including multiple images, social proof, and related items.
*   **Routing:** Utilizes Angular Router for seamless navigation between the main product list and individual product pages without full-page reloads.
*   **API Integration:** Fetches live product data from the `dummyjson.com` API using a dedicated Angular service.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** A professional design inspired by leading platforms like Amazon and Facebook, focusing on a clean aesthetic and intuitive user interaction.

## Technologies Used

*   **Angular (v17+):** The core front-end framework for building the application.
    *   **Standalone Components:** For a modular and streamlined architecture.
    *   **`@for` Control Flow:** For high-performance list rendering.
    *   **Angular Router:** For handling client-side navigation.
*   **TypeScript:** For robust, type-safe code.
*   **RxJS:** For managing asynchronous API calls and data streams.
*   **Angular Services:** To encapsulate API logic and promote code reusability.
*   **Custom Pipes (`filterpip`):** To implement the real-time search functionality declaratively in the template.
*   **HTML5 & Modern CSS:** For structure and advanced styling, including CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts.
